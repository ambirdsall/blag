Taken from the [Berkeley DB](http://www.aosabook.org/en/bdb.html) section of
[The Architecture of Open-Source
Applications](http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html), which breaks up its
discussion of the application's specific architecture with general lessons
and aphorisms. Read the whole thing, it's great.

There's a grimness to these that I find utterly charming: [lesson
3](#design-lesson-3) warns "[s]oftware architecture degrades in direct
proportion to the number of changes made to the software: bug fixes corrode the
layering and new features stress design." It's an approach that treats software
design in general and object orientation in specific (OO as in "code that goes
'not my job, you figure it out'", not as in "code that is organized with
classes") not like a matter of artistic composition so much as intellectual
sanitation. It's a dirty world out there: wash your ass.

It is vital for any complex software package's testing and maintenance that the
software be designed and built as a cooperating set of modules with
well-defined API boundaries. The boundaries can (and should!) shift as needs
dictate, but they always need to be there. The existence of those boundaries
prevents the software from becoming an unmaintainable pile of spaghetti. Butler
Lampson once said that all problems in computer science can be solved by
another level of indirection. More to the point, when asked what it meant for
something to be object-oriented, Lampson said it meant being able to have
multiple implementations behind an API. The Berkeley DB design and
implementation embody this approach of permitting multiple implementations
behind a common interface, providing an object-oriented look and feel, even
though the library is written in C.

<%= section('Design Lesson 2') %>

A software design is simply one of several ways to force yourself to think
through the entire problem before attempting to solve it. Skilled programmers
use different techniques to this end: some write a first version and throw it
away, some write extensive manual pages or design documents, others fill out a
code template where every requirement is identified and assigned to a specific
function or comment. For example, in Berkeley DB, we created a complete set of
Unix-style manual pages for the access methods and underlying components before
writing any code. Regardless of the technique used, it's difficult to think
clearly about program architecture after code debugging begins, not to mention
that large architectural changes often waste previous debugging effort.
Software architecture requires a different mind set from debugging code, and
the architecture you have when you begin debugging is usually the architecture
you'll deliver in that release.

<%= section('Design Lesson 3') %>

Software architecture does not age gracefully. Software architecture degrades
in direct proportion to the number of changes made to the software: bug fixes
corrode the layering and new features stress design. Deciding when the software
architecture has degraded sufficiently that you should re-design or re-write a
module is a hard decision. On one hand, as the architecture degrades,
maintenance and development become more difficult and at the end of that path
is a legacy piece of software maintainable only by having an army of
brute-force testers for every release, because nobody understands how the
software works inside. On the other hand, users will bitterly complain over the
instability and incompatibilities that result from fundamental changes. As a
software architect, your only guarantee is that someone will be angry with you
no matter which path you choose.

<%= section('Design Lesson 4') %>

It doesn't matter how you name your variables, methods, functions, or what
comments or code style you use; that is, there are a large number of formats
and styles that are "good enough." What does matter, and matters very much, is
that naming and style be consistent. Skilled programmers derive a tremendous
amount of information from code format and object naming. You should view
naming and style inconsistencies as some programmers investing time and effort
to lie to the other programmers, and vice versa. Failing to follow house coding
conventions is a firing offense.

<%= section('Design Lesson 5') %>

Software architects must choose their upgrade battles carefully: users will
accept minor changes to upgrade to new releases (if you guarantee compile-time
errors, that is, obvious failures until the upgrade is complete; upgrade
changes should never fail in subtle ways). But to make truly fundamental
changes, you must admit it's a new code base and requires a port of your user
base. Obviously, new code bases and application ports are not cheap in time or
resources, but neither is angering your user base by telling them a huge
overhaul is really a minor upgrade.

<%= section('Design Lesson 6') %>

In library design, respect for the namespace is vital. Programmers who use your
library should not need to memorize dozens of reserved names for functions,
constants, structures, and global variables to avoid naming collisions between
an application and the library.

<%= section('Design Lesson 7') %>

Before we wrote a shared-memory linked-list package, Berkeley DB engineers
hand-coded a variety of different data structures in shared memory, and these
implementations were fragile and difficult to debug. The shared-memory list
package, modeled after the BSD list package (queue.h), replaced all of those
efforts. Once it was debugged, we never had to debug another shared memory
linked-list problem. This illustrates three important design principles: First,
if you have functionality that appears more than once, write the shared
functions and use them, because the mere existence of two copies of any
specific functionality in your code guarantees that one of them is incorrectly
implemented. Second, when you develop a set of general purpose routines, write
a test suite for the set of routines, so you can debug them in isolation.
Third, the harder code is to write, the more important for it to be separately
written and maintained; it's almost impossible to keep surrounding code from
infecting and corroding a piece of code.

<%= section('Design Lesson 8') %>

Write-ahead logging is another example of providing encapsulation and layering,
even when the functionality is never going to be useful to another piece of
software: after all, how many programs care about LSNs in the cache?
Regardless, the discipline is useful and makes the software easier to maintain,
test, debug and extend.

<%= section('Design Lesson 9') %>

Berkeley DB's choice to use page-level locking was made for good reasons, but
we've found that choice to be problematic at times. Page-level locking limits
the concurrency of the application as one thread of control modifying a record
on a database page will prevent other threads of control from modifying other
records on the same page, while record-level locks permit such concurrency as
long as the two threads of control are not modifying the same record.
Page-level locking enhances stability as it limits the number of recovery paths
that are possible (a page is always in one of a couple of states during
recovery, as opposed to the infinite number of possible states a page might be
in if multiple records are being added and deleted to a page). As Berkeley DB
was intended for use as an embedded system where no database administrator
would be available to fix things should there be corruption, we chose stability
over increased concurrency.

<%= section('Design Lesson 10') %>

Berkeley DB's general-purpose design was well rewarded when we added concurrent
data store functionality. Initially Berkeley DB provided only two modes of
operation: either you ran without any write concurrency or with full
transaction support. Transaction support carries a certain degree of complexity
for the developer and we found some applications wanted improved concurrency
without the overhead of full transactional support. To provide this feature, we
added support for API-level locking that allows concurrency, while guaranteeing
no deadlocks. This required a new and different lock mode to work in the
presence of cursors. Rather than adding special purpose code to the lock
manager, we were able to create an alternate lock matrix that supported only
the lock modes necessary for the API-level locking. Thus, simply by configuring
the lock manager differently, we were able provide the locking support we
needed. (Sadly, it was not as easy to change the access methods; there are
still significant parts of the access method code to handle this special mode
of concurrent access.)

<%= section('Design Lesson 11') %>

When you find an architectural problem you don't want to fix "right now" and
that you're inclined to just let go, remember that being nibbled to death by
ducks will kill you just as surely as being trampled by elephants. Don't be too
hesitant to change entire frameworks to improve software structure, and when
you make the changes, don't make a partial change with the idea that you'll
clean up later—do it all and then move forward. As has been often repeated, "If
you don't have the time to do it right now, you won't find the time to do it
later." And while you're changing the framework, write the test structure as
well.

<%= section('Design Lesson 12') %>

Mpool and Log use internal handle methods to facilitate write-ahead logging,
and in some cases, the method declaration is longer than the code it runs,
since the code is often comparing two integral values and nothing more. Why
bother with such insignificant methods, just to maintain consistent layering?
Because if your code is not so object-oriented as to make your teeth hurt, it
is not object-oriented enough. Every piece of code should do a small number of
things and there should be a high-level design encouraging programmers to build
functionality out of smaller chunks of functionality, and so on. If there's
anything we have learned about software development in the past few decades, it
is that our ability to build and maintain significant pieces of software is
fragile. Building and maintaining significant pieces of software is difficult
and error-prone, and as the software architect, you must do everything that you
can, as early as you can, as often as you can, to maximize the information
conveyed in the structure of your software.

<%= section('Design Lesson 13') %>

There is rarely such thing as an unimportant bug. Sure, there's a typo now and
then, but usually a bug implies somebody didn't fully understand what they were
doing and implemented the wrong thing. When you fix a bug, don't look for the
symptom: look for the underlying cause, the misunderstanding, if you will,
because that leads to a better understanding of the program's architecture as
well as revealing fundamental underlying flaws in the design itself.

<%= section('Design Lesson 14') %>

Database recovery is a complex topic, difficult to write and harder to debug
because recovery simply shouldn't happen all that often. In his Turing Award
Lecture, Edsger Dijkstra argued that programming was inherently difficult and
the beginning of wisdom is to admit we are unequal to the task. Our goal as
architects and programmers is to use the tools at our disposal: design, problem
decomposition, review, testing, naming and style conventions, and other good
habits, to constrain programming problems to problems we can solve.
